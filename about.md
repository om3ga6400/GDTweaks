Miscellaneous things to "tweak" your GD experience (with Mac and Android support!), such as:
- Replacing Newgrounds with the Geode icon
- Fix the main menu settings gamepad icon
- Force a certain background / ground (or randomise it!)
- Remove the background / ground
- Move your account icon into another corner
- Remove the exit button
- Replace the "More Games" button with the Textureldr icon
- Hide the achievements / stats button
- Hide Map Packs or replace it with the Hall Of Fame
- Move BetterInfo to the bottom right corner
- Remove the background in the Icon Kit
- Remove the lock in the Icon Kit
- Remove the corner sprite everywhere (it looks better than it sounds, trust me)
- Fix the joystick scroll icon
- Remove the orbs label from levels
- Remove the chains from the end credit screen

and more!
(make sure to use that shiny yellow settings button in the bottom left corner)

PS: please don't be like sdslayer and turn everything on and expect it to work fine :)
