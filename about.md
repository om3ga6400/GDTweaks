Miscellaneous things to change the game if you want, dunno really:
- Skew the title text
- Replace newgrounds with geode
- Remove map packs
- Remove corners
- Remove the level select topper
- Fix the joystick indicator
- Move the betterinfo button
- Replace "More Games" with a texture pack selector
- FIRE IN THE HOLE

and more...
(make sure to use that shiny green settings button in the corner)

Mac support has recently been added (thanks to RayDeeUx), but it could be buggy!
